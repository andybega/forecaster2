Brent crude oil price

The data are composed from two sources:

- BP Statistical Review of World Energy for historical price information
  https://www.bp.com/en/global/corporate/energy-economics/statistical-review-of-world-energy.html
- EIA Brent crude prices to supplement the last year of data

EIA oil prices are nominal while those from BP are real, but since we are only adding EIA prices for the most recent year, I'm not worrying about it. 

## Summary

```{r}
library("dplyr")
library("readr")

oil <- read_csv("output/oil-prices.csv")

glimpse(oil)
```
