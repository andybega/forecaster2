## How are coups measured?

We use the Powell and Thyne lists of coups. For more details and a link to the data, see https://www.jonathanmpowell.com/coup-detat-dataset.html.

## How are the forecasts generated?

The forecasts are created using random forest models that use data from 1960 to 2018 to identify patterns predicting past coups and then 2019 data is used to project 2020 risk estimates. 

## Data

We use several data sources for potential coup predictors:

REIGN - The Rulers, Elections, and Irregular Governance dataset, see https://oefresearch.org/datasets/reign

EPR - Ethnic Power Relations dataset

V-Dem - Varieties of Democracy data project

WDI - the World Bank's World Development Indicators

More details are available at the project GitHub repo (click the GitHub icon on the top right).

## Accuracy

Although the 2020 forecasts are created using models that use data through 2018, we also conduct test forecasts for 2010 to 2019. Since we already know what the record of coups was for this period, we can calculate fit measures. The table below shows the AUC-ROC and AUC-PR. For the AUC-PR, a random forecast will on average achieve a value corresponding to the positive rate in the data, which is shown in the 3rd column.

|Outcome | Cases| Pos. Rate| AUC-ROC| AUC-PR|
|:-------|-----:|--------:|-------:|------:|
|Attempt |    18|    0.012|   0.780|  0.046|
|Coup    |    10|    0.007|   0.794|  0.032|
|Failed  |     9|    0.006|   0.757|  0.025|

Another way to visualize performance is with separation plots. In an ideal model, the red lines, which correspond to coup attempts, etc., will be all the way on the right.
